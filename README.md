Pro Sports Transactions API
===============

Pro Sports Transactions is a Python API client-library for https://www.prosportstransactions.com enabling software engineers, data scientists, and sports fans with the ability to easily retrieve trades, free agent movements, signings, injuries, disciplinary actions, legal/criminal actions, and much more for five of the North American professional leagues: MLB, MLS, NBA, NFL, and NHL.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

**Due to Cloudflare protection on prosportstransactions.com, direct requests are typically blocked.** To use this library effectively, you'll need to run the [Unflare service](https://github.com/iamyegor/Unflare) alongside this library and use the `UnflareRequestHandler`.

## Features

- üèÄ **Multi-Sport Support**: MLB, MLS, NBA, NFL, and NHL
- üöÄ **Multiple Request Handlers**: Direct requests or Cloudflare bypass with UnflareRequestHandler
- ‚ö° **Performance Testing**: Built-in configurable performance benchmarks
- üß™ **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and performance test suites
- üìä **Multiple Output Formats**: DataFrame, dict, or JSON
- üîß **Configurable**: Performance thresholds and request handling options

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Due to Cloudflare protection, you'll need to set up Unflare before using this library:

1. **Install and run Unflare service**: Follow the setup instructions at [https://github.com/iamyegor/Unflare](https://github.com/iamyegor/Unflare)
2. **Start the Unflare service** (typically runs on `http://localhost:5002`)
3. **Use UnflareRequestHandler** in your code (see examples below)

## Quick Start (Recommended)
```python
from datetime import date
import asyncio
import pro_sports_transactions as pst
from pro_sports_transactions.handlers import UnflareRequestHandler, UnflareConfig

# Configure Unflare handler (REQUIRED for bypassing Cloudflare)
config = UnflareConfig(url="http://localhost:5002/scrape")  # Your Unflare service URL
handler = UnflareRequestHandler(config)

# League (MLB, MLS, NBA, NFL, and NHL)
league = pst.League.NBA

# Transaction types: Disciplinary Actions, Injured List, Injuries,
# Legal Incidents, Minor League To/For, Personal Reasons,
# and Movement (e.g., Trades, Acquisitions, Waivers, Draft Picks, etc.)
transaction_types = tuple([t for t in pst.TransactionType])

# Date range: 2022-23 NBA Regular Season
start_date = date.fromisoformat("2022-10-18")
end_date = date.fromisoformat("2023-04-09")

# Pagination: Pro Sports Transactions provides 25 rows per page
starting_row = 0

# Define the coroutine for searching transactions
async def search_transactions() -> str:
    # Search for transactions using Unflare handler
    return await pst.Search(
        league=league,
        transaction_types=transaction_types,
        start_date=start_date,
        end_date=end_date,
        player="LeBron James",
        team="Lakers",
        starting_row=starting_row,
        request_handler=handler  # IMPORTANT: Use Unflare handler
    ).get_dataframe()  # Also supports get_dict() and get_json()

# Example execution block
if __name__ == "__main__":
    df = asyncio.run(search_transactions())
```

## Direct Usage (May Not Work)
```python
# ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Direct requests often fail due to Cloudflare protection
# This example is provided for completeness but may not work reliably

async def search_transactions_direct():
    # Direct usage without handler (likely to be blocked)
    return await pst.Search(
        league=pst.League.NBA,
        transaction_types=tuple([t for t in pst.TransactionType]),
        player="LeBron James"
    ).get_dataframe()
```

## Advanced Usage

### Request Handlers

The library supports different request handlers for various scenarios:

#### Unflare Handler (Recommended - Cloudflare Bypass)
```python
from pro_sports_transactions.handlers import UnflareRequestHandler, UnflareConfig

# Configure Unflare service - REQUIRED for reliable access
# First, set up Unflare: https://github.com/iamyegor/Unflare
config = UnflareConfig(
    url="http://localhost:5002/scrape",  # Your Unflare service URL
    timeout=60000,  # Request timeout in milliseconds
    proxy={"host": "proxy.example.com", "port": 8080}  # Optional proxy
)

handler = UnflareRequestHandler(config)
search = pst.Search(
    league=pst.League.NBA,
    transaction_types=(pst.TransactionType.Movement,),
    request_handler=handler
)

# The handler automatically caches cookies for improved performance
print(f"Cache valid: {handler.is_cache_valid()}")
print(f"Has cached cookies: {handler.has_cached_cookies}")
```

#### Direct Handler (Not Recommended - Often Blocked)
```python
from pro_sports_transactions.handlers import DirectRequestHandler

# ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Direct requests are typically blocked by Cloudflare
# Use this only for testing or if you have alternative access
handler = DirectRequestHandler()
search = pst.Search(
    league=pst.League.NBA,
    transaction_types=(pst.TransactionType.Movement,),
    request_handler=handler
)
```

### Performance Testing

The library includes built-in performance testing capabilities with configurable thresholds:

```python
# Configure performance thresholds in pyproject.toml
[tool.performance-thresholds]
unflare_cache_hit_speedup = 10.0  # Cache hits should be 10x faster than misses
direct_request_timeout = 5.0       # Direct requests should timeout within 5s
unflare_first_request_max = 30.0  # First Unflare request max time in seconds
```

Run performance tests:
```bash
# Run performance tests
poetry run pytest tests/performance/ -m performance

# Run specific performance tests
poetry run pytest tests/performance/handlers/test_unflare_performance.py::test_unflare_cache_speedup
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Connection refused" or "Service unavailable" errors
- **Cause**: Unflare service is not running
- **Solution**: 
  1. Ensure you've installed Unflare: [https://github.com/iamyegor/Unflare](https://github.com/iamyegor/Unflare)
  2. Start the Unflare service (usually `http://localhost:5002`)
  3. Verify the service is accessible: `curl http://localhost:5002/health` (if available)

#### "TypeError: cannot parse from 'NoneType'" errors
- **Cause**: Direct requests being blocked by Cloudflare
- **Solution**: Use `UnflareRequestHandler` instead of default direct requests

#### Slow performance on first request
- **Expected**: First Unflare request takes longer as it bypasses Cloudflare
- **Optimization**: Subsequent requests use cached cookies and are much faster
